# operating_systems_multithreading
In this project we use multithreading. More specific we write and read from the same file at the same time. We use locks in order to control the access of the threads in some key points. Moreover the user can choose percentages of the total threads that will write and read. Our goal is to find the keys. At the end of the report we have documentation on how to run the kiwi-source code.
